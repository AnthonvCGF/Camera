# Camera
It contains tow basic types of camera with respect to MonoCalibration and StereoCalibration. Even though it just a school-level homework, I spend a lot of time in  reproducting some important function including cv2.Calibration, cv2.StereoCalibration,etc.  What's more, I also accomplish the code of nonlinear optimization, by using L-M. The result just has a slight differ compared to scipy.optimize.least_squares. 
https://www.zhihu.com/people/xiang-feng-yi-yang-de-feng-12/posts has detaileed introduction about the codes.
